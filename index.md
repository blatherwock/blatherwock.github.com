About Joseph
------------

I am a data science student, professional software engineer, occasional video gamer, hobbyist artist and musician living in Manhattan. I enjoy music improvisation and composition and I love going to musicals whenever my [partner][blargon] will come with me.


Work
----

I am currently a graduate student studying Computer Science at [Columbia University][columbia]. I've been enjoying learning about data science and machine learning. In the past I have worked as a front-end engineer at [Workday Inc][workday].


Play
----

When not busy with schoolwork I've been exploring indie games on Steam or reading through the Discworld series. (Though I'm careful to avoid games which I know will pull me away from studies for too long!)

Future
------
I'm going to be finishing my Master's degree soon and hope to find a job as a data science engineer. I have enjoyed my studies in the topic and am eager to explore a professional career in the area. If you're hiring data scientists, please check out my [resume][resume] and feel free to send me an email.
