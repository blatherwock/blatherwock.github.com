About Joseph
------------

I am a student, professional software engineer, occasional video gamer, hobbyist artist and musician living in Manhattan. I enjoy music improvisation and composition and I love going to musicals whenever my [partner][blargon] will come with me.


Work
----

I am currently a graduate student studying Computer Science at [Columbia University][columbia]. In the past I have worked as a front end engineer at [Workday Inc][workday] using GWT to build features for Workday's metadata driven UI application.


Play
----

Recently I've been doing projects involving AngularJS, HTML5/CSS3, and JavaScript. On the side when I have time I have been learning Lisp. 

Notable undergrad projects include a [color organizer][color_sorter] and an [image quantizer][color_proportion].


Dream
------

I thrived in an accelerated CS undergraduate program, particurlary the algorithms and computational theory courses. It cultivated a desire to deepen my understanding of those topics and to investigate omitted areas. Studying at Columbia is allowing me to do exactly that and after finishing my degree I hope to find a career that allows me to use that understanding to solve interesting and complex problems.
