Professional Life
-----------------

I am a software developer currently working as a front end engineer at [Workday Inc][workday]. I work with Flex to build features for Workday's metadata driven UI application.

Personal Projects
-----------------

Recently I've been doing projects involving Rails, HTML5/CSS3, javascript. On the side when I have time I have been learning Lisp. 

Some notable school projects were one involving [color organization][color_sorter] and another with [image quantization][color_proportion].

School

I attended an accelerated undergraduate program Computer Science. I particularly enjoyed my algorithms and computational theory classes. In the future I plan to return to school for a MS and potentially a PhD in Computer Science.
