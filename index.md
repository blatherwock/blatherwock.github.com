About Joseph
------------

I am a professional software engineer, occasional video gamer, hobbyist artist and musician living in Manhattan. I enjoy music improvisation and composition and I love going to musicals whenever my [partner][blargon] will come with me.


Work
----

I work as a front end engineer at [Workday Inc][workday]. I use GWT to build features for Workday's metadata driven UI application.


Play
----

Recently I've been doing projects involving AngularJS, HTML5/CSS3, and JavaScript. On the side when I have time I have been learning Lisp. 

Notable school projects include a [color organizer][color_sorter] and an [image quantizer][color_proportion].


Dream
------

I thrived in an accelerated CS undergraduate program, particurlary the algorithms and computational theory courses. It cultivated a desire to deepen my understanding of those topics and to investigate omitted areas. While pursuing personal study, I also hope to continue my formal education and learn more about topics such as machine learning, knowledge representation, and semantic networks.
