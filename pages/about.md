  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a software developer currently working as a front end engineer at <a href="http://www.workday.com">Workday Inc.</a> Professionally I work with Flex to build features for Workday's metadata driven UI application. In my personal projects I work with various technologies such as Ruby, Rails, HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, MySQL, Lisp, and Silverlight.</p>
  <h2>School</h2>
  <p>I attended an accelerated program at Neumont University where I aquired a BS in Computer Science. At Neumont I learned programming and software engineering skills and gained experience in business enviroments through professional internships.</p>
  <p>I particularly enjoyed my algorithms and computational theory classes. In the future I plan to return to school for a MS and potentially a PhD in Computer Science.</p>
  <h2>CS Interests</h2>
  <p>Machine Learning, Knowledge Representation, Semantic Networks</p>
  <h2>Other Interests / Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I have played piano since 2003 and enjoy playing musical numbers from 'The Phantom of the Opera' and 'Wicked' in addition to improvising. I enjoy sketching and playing expansive games like Skyrim to unwind.</p>
