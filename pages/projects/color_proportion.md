Color Proportion/Quantization Tool
----------------------------------

This is a tool that I wrote for some research being performed by Bryan Howell, Industrial Design Professor at BYU. He wanted to be able to measure relative proportions between different colors in images of animals, plants, and other objects. For more information about his research please go to [ColorProportion.com][color_pro_ext].

To see the application live follow the link above or [here][color_pro_large]
